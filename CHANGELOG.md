([df3c315](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/df3c315))
  - **babel.ts:** Add support for TypeScript and legacy syntax in Babel transform This commit adds support for TypeScript and legacy syntax in the Babel transform. The `transform` function now accepts a `ts` and `legacy` option, which when set to true, adds the necessary plugins to support TypeScript and legacy syntax. The `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript`, `babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`, `babel-plugin-parameter-decorator`, `@babel/plugin-syntax-import-assertions`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator`, and `@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining` plugins are added to the list of plugins to be used in the transform. ([bccdea4](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/bccdea4))
  - **types.ts:** Add interfaces for TransformOptions and DYNOTOptions This commit adds two interfaces to the types.ts file. The TransformOptions interface defines the options that can be passed to a transform function. The DYNOTOptions interface defines the options that can be passed to the DYNOT library. These interfaces improve the readability and maintainability of the code by providing a clear definition of the options that can be passed to these functions. ([b5bb8e9](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/b5bb8e9))
  - **utils.ts:** Add utility functions for caching, file system operations, and package.json parsing This commit adds several utility functions to the `utils.ts` file. The `getCacheDir()` function returns a path to a cache directory. The `isDir()` function checks if a given path is a directory. The `isWritable()` function checks if a given path is writable. The `md5()` function returns an MD5 hash of a given string. The `detectLegacySyntax()` function checks if a given string contains legacy syntax. The `isObject()` function checks if a given value is an object. The `readNearestPackageJSON()` function reads the nearest `package.json` file from a given path. These functions are useful for various file system operations and caching. ([0c7fcd0](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/0c7fcd0))
  - **babel-plugin-transform-import-meta.ts:** Add babel plugin to inline resolved filename into code when possible This commit adds a babel plugin that inlines the resolved filename into the code when possible instead of injecting a require. This improves the performance of the application by reducing the number of requires that need to be resolved at runtime. The plugin is based on the babel-plugin-transform-import-meta package, with the modification of inlining the resolved filename. ([09596fb](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/09596fb))
  - **import-meta-env.ts:** Add import-meta-env plugin to support runtime environment variables The import-meta-env plugin is added to support runtime environment variables.

  - **register.js:** Add registration functionality to dynot This commit adds a new file, register.js, which imports the dynot module and calls the register function. This allows dynot to register itself with the Dyno API, which is necessary for the application to function properly. ([f49c0a9](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/f49c0a9))
  - **index.js:** Add onError function and default transform option The onError function is added to handle errors thrown during the execution of the dynot function. The default transform option is set to use the babel module if no transform option is provided. This improves the usability of the module by providing a default option for the transform parameter and a way to handle errors that may occur during execution. ([7e176f5](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/7e176f5))
  - **dynot.js:** Add dynot command line interface This commit adds a new file `dynot.js` which contains the implementation of the dynot command line interface. The dynot command line interface allows users to run scripts in the context of the dynot environment. The script to be run is passed as an argument to the dynot command. If no script is provided, the usage instructions are printed to the console. ([2d7d3d7](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/2d7d3d7))
  - **dynot.js:** Add dynot command line interface This commit adds a new file `dynot.js` which contains the implementation of the dynot command line interface.

The skipped tests in utils.test.ts have been removed as they are no longer needed. Unused imports in esm.js and jiti.js have been removed to improve code readability. ([444e99b](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/444e99b))
  - **async, circular:** Add new test fixtures for async and circular dependencies Added new test fixtures for async and circular dependencies. The async fixture exports a constant string "works" from an async module. The circular fixture exports a function that adds a string "Foo" to a passed string and logs the result to the console. The circular fixture has two modules that import from each other to create a circular dependency. ([c4a3c0b](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/c4a3c0b))
  - **esm:** Add new ES modules fixtures for testing purposes Added new ES modules fixtures for testing purposes. The fixtures include an index.js file that imports consolji, test.js, and utils-lib.js. The test.js file exports an object with information about the file, directory, import.meta.url, and stack trace. The utils-lib.js file exports a version constant and an object with utilities from the utils.js file. The utils.js file exports a constant and a default export. ([9716b32](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/9716b32))
  - **test:** Add new test fixtures for exotic, hashbang, json, and syntax The new test fixtures are added to test various scenarios such as importing JSON files, using optional chaining, nullish coalescing, logical or assignment, and logical nullish assignment. These fixtures will help to ensure that the application works as expected in these scenarios. ([187625e](https://github.com/nyxblabs/dynot/commit/187625e))
  - **typescript:** Add new TypeScript fixtures for testing Added new TypeScript fixtures to the test suite to improve test coverage.
